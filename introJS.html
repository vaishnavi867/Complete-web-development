<!-- javascript is a client side scripting language
it is used to make web pages alive
it is used to programmatically perform actions within the page 
when JAVASCRIPT was created, it was initially called 'live script'
But java was a very popular language at that time, so it was decided that positioning a language as a younger brother of java would help
DOCUMENT OBJECT MODULE: DOM




javascript:
1. Add new html and change the existing html from DOM
2. React to events(event means any kind of action that the user performs and that is recieved by the browser)
Response from server/ keypress/ mouse movement
3. Agax requests(requests which come through network)
4. Get and set cookies and use local storage.

WHAT CAN'T IN BROWSER DO??
1. READ/WRITE to $ from computer hard disk
2. agex requests are denied <browser follows same origin policy>
java script is a very safe programming language

WHAT MAKES JAVASCRIPT UNIQUE?
HTML/CSS support
simple application program interface API for Simple things 
supports major modern browser(enabled by default)
